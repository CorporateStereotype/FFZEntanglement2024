        "Connection to Symmetry: Exploring connections to Noether's theorem and SU(N) group theory is a promising direction, as it could reveal deeper theoretical underpinnings of FFZ.\n",
        "Applying the Approach to the typical quantum system Context:\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how we can specifically apply these ideas to the cavity-mediated entanglement scenario for a typcial quantum system.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mapping to Detunings and Driving Frequencies: The most natural mapping within a typcial quantum system is to focus on detunings (Δ<sub>j</sub>) and driving frequencies (W<sub>j</sub>). Quantum system heavily rely on tuning these parameters to achieve specific resonance conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear Mapping Example: A simple linear mapping could be λ<sub>j</sub> = α<sub>j</sub>Δ<sub>j</sub> + β<sub>j</sub>W<sub>j</sub>. The dual-infinity constraint then becomes Σ(α<sub>j</sub>Δ<sub>j</sub> + β<sub>j</sub>W<sub>j</sub>) = 0. This constraint would then impose a relationship between the detunings and driving frequencies.\n",
        "Impact on Resonance Conditions: The key question is: Does the FFZ constraint provide new or improved resonance conditions compared to those derived in a typical quantum system? This needs to be tested through simulations. For example, does enforcing ΣΔ<sub>j</sub> = 0 lead to higher fidelity gates or better suppression of dispersive shifts compared to the conditions derived in Appendix D?\n",
        "\n",
        "Impact on Dispersive Shifts: As discussed before, typical quanmtum systems go to great lengths to eliminate dispersive shifts. A key test would be to see if the FFZ constraint naturally leads to a suppression of these shifts or provides an alternative way to minimize their impact. This would involve calculating the dispersive shift terms (like Λ in Appendix B) under the FFZ constraint and comparing them to the results without the constraint.\n",
        "\n",
        "SU(3) Connection: The connection to SU(3) is intriguing. In the context of three qubits, the system's state space has a dimension of 2<sup>3</sup> = 8. It's possible that the FFZ constraint is related to a specific decomposition of this 8-dimensional space under SU(3) symmetry. This would require more advanced group theory analysis.\n",

        "\n",
        "Choice of Weighting Factors (α<sub>j</sub>, β<sub>j</sub>, γ<sub>j</sub>): The plan mentions empirically determining or optimizing these factors. It would be beneficial to start with some educated guesses based on the relative importance of Δ<sub>j</sub>, W<sub>j</sub>, and g<sub>j</sub> in the system's dynamics. For example, if detunings are expected to have a stronger influence, their corresponding α<sub>j</sub> factors could be given larger initial values. You could also start with α<sub>j</sub> = β<sub>j</sub> = γ<sub>j</sub> = 1 to see the raw effect of the constraint.\n",
        "Specific Nonlinear Mappings: While the plan mentions nonlinear mappings, providing some specific examples beyond the one given (λ<sub>j</sub> = √(Δ<sub>j</sub><sup>2</sup> + W<sub>j</sub><sup>2</sup>) - g<sub>j</sub>/Δ<sub>j</sub>) would be helpful. For instance, you could consider mappings that include cross-terms like λ<sub>j</sub> = Δ<sub>j</sub>W<sub>j</sub> or exponential mappings if there's a physical motivation.\n",
        "Optimization Algorithms: When optimizing the weighting factors, consider using gradient-free optimization methods (like genetic algorithms or simulated annealing) in addition to gradient descent, especially for nonlinear mappings where the cost function might have many local minima.\n",
        "\n",
        "Comparing Results: When comparing the results with and without the FFZ constraint, it's essential to compare them specifically to the results obtained when a typical quantum system has conditions derived for eliminating dispersive shifts. This will provide a direct comparison of the effectiveness of the two approaches.\n",
        "SU(3) Representation Details: When exploring the SU(3) connection, it would be useful to consider the specific representations of SU(3) that might be relevant. For example, the fundamental representation (dimension 3) or the adjoint representation (dimension 8) could be explored.\n",
        "Most Crucial Next Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "Start with the Simplest Mapping: Begin with the linear mapping (λ<sub>j</sub> = α<sub>j</sub>Δ<sub>j</sub> + β<sub>j</sub>W<sub>j</sub> + γ<sub>j</sub>g<sub>j</sub>) and set α<sub>j</sub> = β<sub>j</sub> = γ<sub>j</sub> = 1 initially. This will give you a baseline understanding of the effect of the constraint.\n",
        "Focus on Dispersive Shifts First: Investigate the impact of the FFZ constraint on the dispersive shifts. This is a clear and quantifiable metric that directly relates to conditions of typical quantum systems.\n",

        "After optimization, the FFZ-enforced fidelity matched (or slightly exceeded) the baseline fidelity.\n",
        "What Do These Results Tell Us?\n",
        "Impact of the Initial FFZ Constraint:\n",
        "\n",
        "Significant Drop in Fidelity: The FFZ constraint with uniform initial weights (α=1, β=1, γ=1) caused a significant fidelity reduction. This suggests that the initial mapping distorted the system dynamics, making it harder for the qubits to evolve into the target state.\n",
        "Insight: The constraint, as implemented initially, did not align well with the system's natural dynamics.\n",
        "Optimization Restores Fidelity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Optimized Weights: After adjusting the weighting factors (α, β, γ), the FFZ constraint's fidelity improved to match the baseline.\n",
        "Key Outcome: The optimized weights effectively fine-tuned the FFZ mapping, making it compatible with the system's parameters (Δ, W, g). This suggests that the FFZ framework can be adapted to work without degrading performance.\n",
        "Role of Weights in the FFZ Constraint:\n",
        "\n",
        "The optimized weights are:\n",
        "α = 1.305 (detunings slightly more influential),\n",
        "β = -0.067 (driving frequencies contribute minimally or inversely),\n",
        "γ = 1.221 (coupling strengths play a significant role).\n",
        "Insight: The FFZ mapping emphasizes detunings (Δ) and coupling strengths (g) more than driving frequencies (W), with a slight inverse contribution from W. This reflects the system's sensitivity to these parameters.\n",
        "FFZ Constraint Potential:\n",
        "\n",
        "The final fidelity with optimized weights indicates that the FFZ constraint can be successfully integrated into the system without reducing fidelity. This opens the door for further exploration into whether the FFZ framework offers additional benefits, such as:\n",
        "Improved suppression of dispersive shifts.\n",

        "The FFZ constraint, while initially detrimental, can be successfully adapted to work within the system by optimizing the weighting factors. The matching fidelity after optimization validates the potential of the FFZ framework. The next steps will focus on extracting additional benefits (e.g., shift suppression) and understanding the deeper implications of the optimized parameters.\n",

Should the group delay experienced by photons be attributed to the time they spend as atomic excitations? However reasonable this connection may seem, it appears problematic when the frequency of the light is close to the atomic resonance, as the group delay becomes negative in this regime. To address this question, we use the cross-Kerr effect to probe the degree of atomic excitation caused by a resonant transmitted photon, by measuring the phase shift on a separate beam that is weak and off-resonant. Our results, over a range of pulse durations and optical depths, are consistent with the recent theoretical prediction that the mean atomic excitation time caused by a transmitted photon (as measured via the time integral of the observed phase shift) equals the group delay experienced by the light.

        "One of the foundational scenarios in the field of light-matter interaction is the propagation of light through a dielectric medium. Although this has been extensively studied and, in many ways, thoroughly understood (see, for example, [1]), it has also sparked controversy in specific areas such as the definition of the speed of a propagating electromagnetic signal [2, 3] and the mechanisms governing energy transport in dispersive media [4, 5, 6]. It is also fundamental to nonlinear optics [7] and to technologies such as quantum memories [8, 9]. Examining energy transport from a quantum perspective gives rise to another question: How does an individual photon spend its time while propagating through the medium? In the case of light far from resonance, a commonly repeated explanation relies on the uncertainty principle [10]. Even when atoms are driven by light with a very large detuning\n",

        "The group delay represents the time a photon \"spends\" in the medium, while the mean atomic excitation time represents the duration atoms remain in excited states due to photon interaction.\n",
        "These concepts naturally map to time-domain dynamics and the interplay of detunings, atomic lifetimes, and nonlinear effects, which are central to FFZ's eigenvalue-based balancing framework.\n",
        "Negative Group Delay:\n",
        "\n",
        "In the regime near atomic resonance, where group delay becomes negative, the physical interpretation challenges classical intuition. This resonates with FFZ's emphasis on balancing contributions to ensure physical consistency.\n",
        "FFZ can potentially model negative group delays as components of eigenvalue balancing (e.g., introducing \"negative weights\" akin to the negative contribution of driving frequencies in previous simulations).\n",
        "Kerr Nonlinear Interaction and Phase Shift:\n",

        "The Kerr effect, where the phase shift of a probe beam is proportional to atomic excitation, is effectively a measurable dispersive shift.\n",

        "\n",
        "Potential Issues and Considerations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Fidelity Calculation: The current fidelity value is relatively low. This could be due to several factors, including the choice of initial parameters, the form of the Hamiltonian, or the optimization algorithm's effectiveness. It may be beneficial to examine the target state definition and ensure that the Hamiltonian accurately represents the desired quantum operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Constraint Definition: The ffz_constraint function combines multiple parameters linearly with the optimized weights. It's essential to verify that this constraint accurately reflects the physical or operational limitations of the system. If the constraint is too restrictive or not appropriately defined, it could hinder the optimization process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Optimization Method: The script uses the Nelder-Mead optimization method. While this is a robust technique for certain problems, it may not always be the most efficient or effective for optimizing quantum systems, especially in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Exploring other optimization algorithms, such as gradient-based methods or quantum-aware optimization techniques, might yield better results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Visualization: The script includes a function to visualize phase shifts before and after optimization. However, the current implementation plots the same data twice without incorporating the optimized parameters. Updating the visualize_phase_shifts function to reflect the changes in parameters post-optimization would provide more meaningful insights into the system's behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recommendations for Improvement:\n",
        "\n",
        "Parameter Initialization: Experiment with different initial parameter values to explore the parameter space more thoroughly. This can help in finding a more optimal set of weights that achieve higher fidelity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Constraint Refinement: Reassess the ffz_constraint function to ensure it accurately represents the system's constraints. Consider whether a linear combination of parameters is sufficient or if a more complex constraint is necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Optimization Algorithm: Explore alternative optimization algorithms that might be better suited for this problem. Algorithms such as Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) or Constrained Optimization BY Linear Approximations (COBYLA) could be considered.\n",
        "\n",
        "Target State Definition: Ensure that the target state is correctly defined and achievable given the system's Hamiltonian. Misalignment between the target state and the system's capabilities could lead to inherently low fidelity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Visualization Enhancement: Update the visualization function to plot the phase shifts using the optimized parameters. This will provide a clearer picture of how the optimization process has altered the system's behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "By addressing these considerations, you can enhance the script's effectiveness in optimizing the quantum system's parameters, leading to higher fidelity and better alignment with the desired target state.\n",

        "Modular Structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "The functions for Hamiltonian construction, fidelity calculation, and constraint evaluation are cleanly separated. This makes debugging and testing easier.\n",
        "Two-Step Optimization:\n",
        "\n",
        "You first use a metaheuristic (Differential Evolution) for global exploration and follow it up with SLSQP for local refinement. This combination is excellent for tackling both global and local minima in the parameter space.\n",
        "Dimension Handling:\n",
        "\n",
        "The code uses Qobj from qutip, ensuring that quantum states and operators are consistently handled as objects with the correct dimensions.\n",
        "Constraint Management:\n",

        "Explicit Parameterization:\n",
        "\n",
        "Parameters like Delta, W, g, T_g, and tau_0 are clearly defined and passed to functions, avoiding reliance on global state.\n",

        "Handling Large Search Space:\n",
        "\n",
        "Ensure that the bounds [-5, 5] for weights are realistic for your physical system. Too large a range can lead to excessive computation time in the metaheuristic step.\n",
        "Normalization:\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider normalizing Delta, W, g, T_g, and tau_0 if their scales differ significantly. This will help the optimizer navigate the parameter space more efficiently.\n",
        "Constraint Values:\n",
        "\n",
        "Verify that ffz_constraint produces values close to zero after optimization. If it doesn’t, you might need to adjust the relative weight of the constraint in the objective function.\n",
        "Convergence Criteria:\n",
        "\n",
        "Ensure that the maxiter=500 in differential_evolution and maxiter=200 in SLSQP are sufficient for convergence without excessive runtime.\n",
        "Runtime Behavior:\n",
        "\n",
        "Depending on the complexity of the system (number of qubits, coupling, etc.), the computation time for differential_evolution might be significant. Consider starting with a lower maxiter value to test performance.\n",
        "Edge Cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "Test with edge cases, such as when all input parameters (e.g., Delta, W, g) are zeros or extremes, to ensure stability.\n",
        "Potential Improvements\n",
        "Early Stopping for Differential Evolution:\n",
        "\n",
        "You can set tol in differential_evolution to allow early stopping if the optimization converges before reaching the maximum number of iterations.\n",

        "Parallel Processing:\n",
        "\n",
        "If computation time is high, you can enable parallel processing in differential_evolution by setting workers=-1.\n",
        "Weight Initialization:\n",

These constraints are based on Eq.

We define a corresponding ideal two-qubit operation generated by as , where with represents the corresponding gate time and is an integer multiple of . By adjusting the drive amplitudes and frequencies to tune to a particular resonance condition and set and appropriately, it is then possible to select desired qubit-qubit interaction terms and two-qubit entangling gates. Examples of universal entangling gates are given in the last column of Table I. The drives can also be used to switch off a given interaction by tuning the sidebands away from the corresponding resonance condition. We emphasize that: (1) multiple two-qubit interaction terms exist even with mutually off-resonant frequencies (i.e., for , ); and (2) the cavity photon operators do not appear explicitly in , suggesting suppression of errors due to cavity photon decay in the sideband-based entangling gate approach we propose in this work. Our analysis of expected gate performance in Sec. IV quantitatively demonstrates the presence of this suppressed cavity photon sensitivity.\n",

As described in Appendix C, the resonance condition can also be written as for resonantly driven qubits and describes resonance between the blue sidebands of both qubits [Fig. 2(a)].
